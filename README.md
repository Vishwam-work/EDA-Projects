# EDA-Projects
Exploratory Data Analysis Project 
Description
This repository contains two exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects: HR Analysis - Attrition Rate and Airline Statistics. Each project focuses on analyzing relevant datasets to gain insights and present findings using Python and data visualization libraries.

# Projects
1. HR Analysis 
This project aims to analyze the attrition rate within a company's human resources department. By examining various factors such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, we seek to identify patterns and potential causes of attrition. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

2. Airline Statistics

The Airline Statistics project focuses on exploring and visualizing datasets related to the airline industry. It involves analyzing factors such as flight delays, cancellations, and customer satisfaction to understand the performance and trends within the airline sector. Python, along with libraries like Pandas and Seaborn, is utilized for data manipulation and visualization purposes.
